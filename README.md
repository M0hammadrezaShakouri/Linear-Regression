# Linear-Regression
Linear Regression using stochastic gradient descent and batch gradient descent

In this project, I used 2 identical datasets, one normal and one with some outliers which include information about height, weight and sex of some random people.

My objective in this project is to implement stochastic gradient descent (2000 epochs) 
and batch gradient descent (2000 epochs) algorithms for linear regression on heights (X) and  weights (Y).

I performed the following tasks :

1. Normalize the datasets so that the values of each feature change between 0 (for min. value of the feature) and 1
(for max. value of the feature).

2. Train each model separately on the normalized datasets and plot the datasets alongside with the obtained
regression model. For these plots, the X axis should be the height feature and the Y axis should be the weight
feature. In addition, you should discriminate males and females by using different colors. (4 figures)
